Family Policy for ChatGPTBot:

Introduction:
ChatGPTBot is a chatbot that can engage in conversations with users on a wide variety of topics. While ChatGPTBot is not designed specifically for children, we understand that many children may use our app. As a result, we have implemented the following family policy to ensure that children are safe and that parents have control over their children's use of the app.

Privacy:
We take privacy very seriously, especially when it comes to children. We do not collect any personal information from our users, including children. We do use Google AdMob to display advertisements in the app, but we do not use AdMob to collect any personally identifiable information from users. We recommend that parents review the AdMob privacy policy to learn more about how their child's information may be used by AdMob.

Safety:
We take safety very seriously, and we have implemented several measures to ensure that ChatGPTBot is a safe environment for children. Firstly, we do not allow any inappropriate or harmful content to be shared through our app. If any inappropriate content is reported to us, we will take immediate action to remove it. Additionally, we use machine learning algorithms to identify and filter out potentially harmful messages. However, we cannot guarantee that all harmful content will be detected and removed, so we recommend that parents monitor their child's use of the app.

Parental Controls:
We recommend that parents supervise their child's use of ChatGPTBot. Parents can set up parental controls on their child's device to limit the amount of time their child spends on the app. Parents can also block certain features or disable the app entirely if they wish.

Conclusion:
We hope that this family policy has provided parents with the information they need to ensure that their child is safe while using ChatGPTBot. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at coolwit@gmail.com
